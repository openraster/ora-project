# OpenRaster Project

This repository is for giving the project direction,
and for documenting procedures for managing the specification.

* Store project docs in this repo itself.
* Use the issue tracker to discuss the project as a whole, and to report problems with processes.
* Minutes of face-to-face meetings go in the wiki.

The specification itself is maintained in [openraster/ora-spec](https://github.com/openraster/ora-spec).
